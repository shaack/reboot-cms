# Reboot CMS

A flat file, Markdown CMS in PHP, inspired by [Pico](http://picocms.org), [Redaxo](https://redaxo.org/) and
[Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

Reboot CMS is a minimal CMS without needing a database, but with the support of `Blocks`.

## Why another CMS?

I developed Reboot CMS because I didn't find a CMS that works with flat markdown files but allows easy use of blocks.

Reboot CMS is very small and the pages are delivered extremely fast. My homepage [shaack.com](https://shaack.com), which
was build with Reboot CMS has a
[PageSpeed Insights performance scoring of 100](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshaack.com%2F).

## Websites using Reboot CMS

- [The Reboot CMS demo page](https://shaack.com/projekte/reboot-cms/)
- [shaack.com](https://shaack.com)
- [wukies.de](https://wukies.de)
- [chesscoin032.com](https://chesscoin032.com)

## Install

Download the [Reboot CMS repository](https://github.com/shaack/reboot-cms) and install it in your web root.

This should work out of the box.

Then (**important**), **set the Admin password in `/local/.htpasswd`**

## Documentation

### Page

Folder: `/site/pages`

A `Page` can be a **flat Markdown** file, can contain **Blocks** or also can be a **PHP** file.

Pages are auto-routed on web-requests:

- `index.md` or `index.php` will be shown on requesting `/`
- `NAME.md` or `NAME.php` will be shown on requesting `/NAME`
- `FOLDER/index.md` (or .php) will be shown on requesting `/FOLDER`
- `FOLDER/NAME.md` (or .php) will be shown on requesting `/FOLDER/NAME`

Example for a Markdown `Page` with `Blocks`:

```markdown
---
title: Reboot CMS 
description: Reboot CMS is a flat file CMS, with the support of blocks. 
author: Stefan Haack (shaack.com)

<!-- jumbotron -->

# Reboot CMS

A flat file, markdown CMS with blocks

---
The main idea is, to have a **minimal CMS** without needing a database, but with the support of blocks.

<!-- text-image -->

## The text-image block

The gray block above was a jumbotron block. This one is a text-image block, it contains two parts. Parts are separated
by `---`.

---
![alt text](dummy.svg "Title Text")

<!-- 
text-image:
    image-position: left
-->

## Configure blocks in the block comment

The text-image block can also display the image to the left.

---
![alt text](dummy.svg "Title Text")>

<!-- three-columns -->

### block

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
aliqua.

```

This `Page` contains 3 `Block` types, "jumbotron", "text-image" and "three-columns". It will render to this:

![A rendered page](https://shaack.com/projekte/assets/img/reboot-cms-index.png)

Blocks can be configured in the block comment. With this configuration, the `text-image`
block allows to display the image to the left side in desktop view.

Markdown files without blocks will render to a flat Markdown page like in every other flat file CMS.

You can define metadata for the page on top of the file in `YAML Front Matter` syntax.

### Block

Folder: `/site/blocks`

A `Block` describes how a block is rendered. Blocks are written in PHP.

The code for the "text-image" `Block` which was used in the page above, looks like this:

```php
<?php
// read the configuration
$imagePosition = @$block->getConfig()["image-position"];
?>
<section class="block block-text-image">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-7 <?= $imagePosition === "left" ? "order-md-1" : "" ?>">
                <!-- all text from part 1 (xpath statement) -->
                <?= $block->xpath("/*[part(1)]") ?>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5">
                <!-- using attributes of the image in part 2 -->
                <img class="img-fluid" src="/media/<?= $block->xpath("//img[part(2)]/@src") ?>"
                     alt="<?= $block->xpath("//img[part(2)]/@alt") ?>"
                     title="<?= $block->xpath("//img[part(2)]/@title") ?>"/>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
```

Elements in the markdown are queried and used as values for the block. The query syntax
is [Xpath](https://devhints.io/xpath) with the addition of the `part(n)` function.

Another example, the "jumbotron" `Block`:

```php
<?php /* jumbotron */ ?>
<section class="block block-jumbotron">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <!-- use the text of the <h1> in part 1 for the display-4 -->
            <h1 class="display-4"><?= $block->xpath("/h1[part(1)]/text()") ?></h1>
            <!-- the lead will be the text of the <p> in part 1 -->
            <p class="lead"><?= $block->xpath("/p[part(1)]/text()") ?></p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <!-- print everything from part 2 -->
            <?= $block->xpath("/*[part(2)]") ?>
            <p>
                <!-- the link in part 3 will be used as the primary button -->
                <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="<?= $block->xpath("//a[part(3)]/@href") ?>"
                   role="button"><?= $block->xpath("//a[part(3)]/text()") ?></a>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>
```

## Admin interface

You find the admin interface unter `/admin`. The default login is

- user: admin
- pwd: change_me

You can and should change the admin password in `local/.htpasswd` with

```sh 
cd local
htpasswd .htpasswd admin
```

In the admin interface you can edit markdown pages and set the site configuration in which the navigation structure is
defined.

### Edit a flat markdown page

### Edit the site configuration

In the site configuration, you can store global values of the site, like the navigation structure or the content of header elements. The site configuration is written in YAML.
