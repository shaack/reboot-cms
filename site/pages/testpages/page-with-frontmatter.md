# Page with frontmatter

The page has some Frontmatter on top, which is not displayed in the webpage.

It looks like this:

```

Author: Stefan Haack
hide-nav: true

---
```

The `hide-nav: true` configuration in the Frontmatter is used to remove the navigation in this page.
This works, because the Frontmatter of the page can be read in the template.
